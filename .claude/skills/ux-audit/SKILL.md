# UX Audit (BoulevardTCG)

Scope: $ARGUMENTS

Deliver:
1) Top 10 UX issues (ranked by impact on conversion/trust)
2) Concrete fixes with exact files/components to edit
3) Mobile-first checklist (spacing, tap targets, layout, sticky CTA)
4) Accessibility checklist (labels, focus, contrast, keyboard)
5) Visual consistency checklist (typography, spacing scale, buttons, cards)

Rules:
- Do NOT redesign everything. Focus on shipping improvements.
- Prefer reuse existing components/styles in the repo.
- Provide actionable steps (file paths + what to change).
